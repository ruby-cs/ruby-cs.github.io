      <h2>Code Snippet</h2>
      <pre><code>
      int red = 9; // assigning the red LED to pin 9
      int green = 10; // assigning the green Led to pin 10
      int blue = 11; // assigning the blue LED to pin 11
      int buttonPin = 2; // assigning the pushbutton to pin 2
      int brightness = 0;  // how bright the LED is
      int fadeAmount = 5;  // how many points to fade the LED by
      int buttonState = 0; // initializing buttonState

      // the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
      void setup() {
        // declare LEDs to be an output:
        pinMode(red, OUTPUT); // declares red LED as an output
        pinMode(green, OUTPUT); // declares red LED as an output
        pinMode(blue, OUTPUT); // declares red LED as an output
        pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT); // declares the pushbutton pin as an input
      }

      // the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
      void loop() {
        // read the state of the pushbutton value:
        buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
        // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
        if (buttonState == HIGH) {
          for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) { // for loop up until brightness of 255
            analogWrite(red, i); // writes brightness of red LED
            delay(30); // waits 30 milliseconds
          }
          for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) { // for loop up until brightness of 255
            analogWrite(green, i); // writes brightness of green LED
            delay(30); // waits 30 milliseconds
          }
          for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) { // for loop up until brightness of 255
            analogWrite(blue, i); // writes brightness of blue LED
            delay(30); // waits 30 milliseconds
          }
        } else {
          // turn LEDs off when button isn't pressed
          digitalWrite(red, LOW); // turn red LED Off
          digitalWrite(green, LOW); // turn green LED off
          digitalWrite(blue, LOW); // turn blue LED off
        }

      <h2>Questions</h2><br>
      <h3>Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led,64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led, 255).</h3><br>
      <p>A brightness of 64 is 25% of the duty cycle, 128 is 50%, and 255 is 100%.</p><br>

      <h3>Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</h3><br>
      <p>If V = IR, the voltage is 5V, the red and green LEDs have a voltage drop of 1.8V and use 220 ohm resistors, and the blue LED has a voltage drop of 3.3V and uses a 100 ohm resistor, the total current would be 14.5mA + 14.5mA + 17mA = 46mA. A 1200 mAh battery would last approximately 1200 mAh/46 mA = 26.09 hours.</p><br>
      <h3>Measure and record the actual voltage across one of your LEDs when it's on. How does this compare to the theoretical forward voltage for your LED color?</h3><br>
      <p>For the red LED on the RGB LED, I measured a voltage of 1.91V when it was on. It was slightly higher than the theoretical forward voltage of 1.8V.</p><br>
