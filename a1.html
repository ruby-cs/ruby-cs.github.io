      <p>// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board<br>

      <h2>Questions</h2><br>
      <h3>Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</h3>
      <p>The red and green LED blink on, the red LED turns off after 1 second, the green LED stays on for 3 seconds before turning off, then the blue LED blinks on for 5 seconds and turns off.</p>
      <img src="voltagevstime.jpg"/><br>
      <h3>How many LEDs could you blink indepdently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</h3>
      <p>You could blink 20 LEDs indepdently with the Arduino (pins 0-13 and A0-A5). The amount of current would depend on the types of LEDs and resistors. If you used all red LEDs, it would draw 290 mA total. With a 220 ohm resistor, red LEDs would draw 14.5 mA each and 14.5*20=290.</p><br>
      <h3>How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</h3>
      <p>LEDs need to blink more than 0.01 seconds before you can no longer tell they are blinking.</p><br>
      <h3>Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment?</h3>
      <p>No.</p>
